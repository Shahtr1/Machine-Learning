- `6-step-ml-framework.png`: A PNG image illustrating the 6-step machine learning framework.
- `car-sales-missing-data.csv`: CSV file containing car sales data with missing values.
- `car-sales-missing-dropped.csv`: CSV file containing car sales data after dropping rows with missing values.
- `car-sales.csv`: CSV file containing car sales data.
- `example-notebook.ipynb`: Example Jupyter notebook.
- `exported-car-sales.csv`: CSV file containing exported car sales data.
- `heart-disease.csv`: CSV file containing heart disease data.
- `Introduction to pandas.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook introducing pandas.
- `Introduction to numpy.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook introducing numpy.
- `Introduction to Matplotlib.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook introducing matplotlib.

## Setting up the Project

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Create the conda environment:
   Open a Miniconda prompt and navigate to the project location. Then type:

   ```sh
   conda env create --file .\environment.yml --prefix ./env
   ```

3. Activate the conda environment:
   ```sh
   conda activate ./env
   ```

## Using Jupyter Notebooks

Once the environment is set up and activated, you can start Jupyter notebooks with the following command:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```
