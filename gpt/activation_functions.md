# Activation Functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh 🚀

## 📌 What is an Activation Function?

An **activation function** is a mathematical function that determines whether a neuron should be activated or not. It introduces **non-linearity**, allowing neural networks to learn **complex patterns**.

If we **don’t** use an activation function:

- The neural network behaves like **just a big linear equation** 🤦‍♂️.
- It **cannot learn complex patterns**.
- We need **non-linearity** to model things like images, speech, and language.

## 📌 Why Not Just Use One Type for Everything?

Different activation functions have **different behaviors**, so we need to **choose the right one** for the situation.

👉 If you choose **the wrong activation function**, the network might:

- **Learn very slowly** (vanishing gradient problem).
- **Not be able to make good decisions**.
- **Get stuck** (neurons die or become unresponsive).

## 📌 Detailed Explanation of ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh

### 🔹 1. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)

#### 🔢 Formula

$$
ReLU(x) = \max(0, x)
$$

- If `x > 0`, return `x`.
- If `x < 0`, return `0`.

#### 🧠 Mathematical Intuition

ReLU **removes negative values** and **keeps positive values unchanged**.  
This makes the model **focus on important features** while ignoring useless ones.

#### 🔥 Why ReLU is Powerful

✅ **Prevents vanishing gradients** – Unlike Sigmoid/Tanh, ReLU doesn’t have small derivatives.  
✅ **Computationally efficient** – Just checks if `x > 0`, no exponentials.  
✅ **Encourages sparsity** – Sets some neurons to 0, making the network more efficient.

#### ❌ Problems with ReLU

⛔ **Dying ReLU Problem**: If too many neurons get negative values, they turn **permanently off** (always output 0).  
⛔ **Only works for positive numbers** – Loses negative information.

#### 🛠 Solution: Leaky ReLU

$$
LeakyReLU(x) =
\begin{cases}
x, & x > 0 \\
0.01x, & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

Instead of setting negatives to 0, LeakyReLU **keeps a small value** (like `0.01x`) so neurons don’t die.

### 🔹 2. Sigmoid Activation Function

#### 🔢 Formula

$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

- Always outputs a value **between 0 and 1**.

#### 🧠 Mathematical Intuition

The sigmoid function **squashes large inputs** into small values between **0 and 1**.  
This makes it great for **binary classification** because the output can be interpreted as a **probability**.

#### 🔥 Why Sigmoid is Useful

✅ **Great for probabilities** – Values between 0 and 1 make it easy to interpret as a probability.  
✅ **Smooth function** – Helps in small networks.

#### ❌ Problems with Sigmoid

⛔ **Vanishing Gradient Problem**:

- When `x` is very large (`x > 5`), the function **saturates** at 1.
- When `x` is very small (`x < -5`), the function **saturates** at 0.
- This makes gradients **very small**, **slowing down learning**.

⛔ **Outputs are not centered around 0** – This makes training slow because all activations are positive.

#### 🛠 Solution: Use ReLU or Tanh instead in deep networks!

---

### 🔹 3. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent) Activation Function

#### 🔢 Formula

$$
\tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}
$$

- Always outputs a value **between -1 and 1**.

#### 🧠 Mathematical Intuition

Tanh is **similar to Sigmoid**, but it’s **better** because:

- It is **centered around 0** (unlike Sigmoid).
- The function **squashes values** but allows negative numbers.

#### 🔥 Why Tanh is Useful

✅ **Better than Sigmoid** – Because it outputs **negative and positive values**, making training easier.  
✅ **Useful for small networks** – Works well in shallow models.

#### ❌ Problems with Tanh

⛔ **Still has the vanishing gradient problem** – If inputs are too large, derivatives go to **zero**, making learning slow.  
⛔ **Uses exponentials** – More computationally expensive than ReLU.

## 📌 Comparing Activation Functions

| Activation  | Formula                           | Range       | Best for              | Problem             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| **ReLU**    | `max(0, x)`                       | `0` to `+∞` | Deep networks         | Dying ReLU problem  |
| **Sigmoid** | `1 / (1 + e^(-x))`                | `0` to `1`  | Binary classification | Vanishing gradients |
| **Tanh**    | `(e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))` | `-1` to `1` | Small networks        | Vanishing gradients |

## 📌 When to Use Each Activation Function?

### ✅ **ReLU** → Best for most deep learning models!

- Use **in hidden layers** (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers).
- Helps avoid **vanishing gradients**.
- **If neurons die**, try **LeakyReLU**.

### ✅ **Sigmoid** → Best for classification problems!

- Use **in the last layer** when output is a **probability** (e.g., spam detection).
- Don’t use in deep networks because of **vanishing gradients**.

### ✅ **Tanh** → Best for small networks!

- Use when values need to be between **-1 and 1**.
- Avoid in deep networks due to **vanishing gradients**.

## 📌 How Activation Functions Affect Backpropagation

During training, the **backward pass (backpropagation)** computes gradients.  
The **activation function affects gradients** by controlling how **fast or slow weights update**.

### **How ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh Affect Learning**

| Activation  | Gradient Behavior                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ReLU**    | Large gradient for `x > 0`, zero for `x < 0`.                      |
| **Sigmoid** | Small gradient if `x` is very large or very small (slow learning). |
| **Tanh**    | Similar to Sigmoid but centered at 0, slightly better.             |

### 🔢 ReLU Gradient

$$
ReLU'(x) =
\begin{cases}
1, & x > 0 \\
0, & x \leq 0
\end{cases}
$$

### 🔢 Leaky ReLU Gradient

$$
LeakyReLU'(x) =
\begin{cases}
1, & x > 0 \\
0.01, & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

### 🔢 Sigmoid Gradient

$$
\sigma'(x) = \sigma(x) \cdot (1 - \sigma(x))
$$

### 🔢 Tanh Gradient

$$
\tanh'(x) = 1 - \tanh^2(x)
$$

### **Why ReLU is Better in Deep Networks**

- Sigmoid & Tanh **make gradients too small** (slow learning).
- ReLU keeps **large gradients**, so the network learns faster.

## 📌 Final Takeaway

✅ **ReLU is the best for deep networks** (fast, avoids vanishing gradients).  
✅ **Use Sigmoid for classification (0-1 output, probability interpretation).**  
✅ **Use Tanh for small networks, but avoid in deep networks.**
